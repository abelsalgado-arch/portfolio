The **AI Lead IQ Dashboard** simulates a modern SDR/BDR workflow using AI to accelerate research, qualification, and outbound messaging.

This tool allows a user to:

- Automatically enrich the company with AI-generated data  
- Generate a 0–100 ICP Fit Score  
- Understand *why* the lead is a strong or weak fit  
- Produce a tailored cold email + LinkedIn message  
- Follow recommended next steps to open a conversation

## 🎯 Why I Built This  
I created this project to demonstrate:

- My understanding of B2B tech sales workflows  
- My ability to think like a modern, solutions-oriented seller  
- My curiosity and comfort with AI tools  
- My initiative to build sales enablement assets, not just talk about them  

This project lets me show hiring managers that I can blend **AI, communication, and business thinking** to drive better sales outcomes.

## 🎯 Why I Built This  
I created this project to demonstrate:

- My understanding of B2B tech sales workflows  
- My ability to think like a modern, solutions-oriented seller  
- My curiosity and comfort with AI tools  
- My initiative to build sales enablement assets, not just talk about them  

This project lets me show hiring managers that I can blend **AI, communication, and business thinking** to drive better sales outcomes.
